Project 3 RSA Encryption/Decryption


When doing Encryption enter the ascii text file not a block file
The block and unblock button is use for testing block and unblock 

Assume user input correct type of file

NOTE: 

    Fileopener or fileopener class might give an error because the name
    doesn't change on commits for some reason. So if Fileopener.java is named fileopener.java
    please simply change the name of the class to "Fileopener." Sorry for the incovenience.

    FileUtilities.java: There are 4 data members in this class that last one "currentPath" has 
    a commented counterpart. This is because depending on how you set up the project folders in eclipse
    the currentPath might be different. It was for me and Alex and we have a trouble with this.
    This if you reach a point where you can't open the primes.txt file please try
    using the other declaration of "currentPath." Thank you! and again sorry for the inconvience
